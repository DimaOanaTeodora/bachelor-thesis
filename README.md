### Abstract
The “Adopt a friend” application aims to reduce the number of abandoned pets in Romania by facilitating their adoption process. Users can post ads when they want to send a pet for adoption, if they have lost theirs or if they have found one and want to find its owner or a new foster family.
The adoption process is supported by an algorithm that matches the user’s psychological profile with the animals available in the database. The profile of each user is outlined following their responses to a short personality test. Furthermore, the app helps those who already have a pet by centralizing a wide and diverse list of dedicated and localized services such as dog walking, pet sitting, pharmacies and vet clinics, shelters and hostels or cosmetic care services for pets.
Another goal that “Adopt a friend” has is to develop an online community involved in the protection and taking care of animals. Being a mobile application is the perfect way to achieve this target. Designed for Android, it increases the engagement and loyalty of smartphone users, building a bridge between the digital and physical environment and connecting animal lovers across the country.
